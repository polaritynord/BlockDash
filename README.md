[![Available on itch.io](http://jessemillar.github.io/available-on-itchio-badge/badge-bw.png)](https://zerpnord.itch.io/blockdash)

BlockDash is a simple-graphics 2D game filled with action. Run, shoot, run, dash. just make sure you don't reload near those enemies. They can dash at you as well.

Movements are already explained inside the game, but here, I wrote it anyways to make the page look more formal.

Key(s)  | Action Name
------------- | -------------
W, A, S, D  | Move
E | Pick up Weapon
1, 2, 3, 4 | Switch Slots
Q | Quick Slot Switch (really useful in medium/hard)
ESC | Pause & Continue Game
F1 | Open Debug Menu
